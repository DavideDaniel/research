# Research Papers

In-depth technical analysis to help engineers evaluate frameworks, tools, and practices.

---

### [Autonomous AI Agents: Execution Loops vs Interactive Assistance](/papers/autonomous-agents/)

Evidence synthesis comparing autonomous AI agent execution loops against interactive human-in-the-loop assistance, covering SWE-bench benchmarks, the METR RCT, industry telemetry, and adjacent domain evidence.

**Topics:** Autonomous agents, execution loops, SWE-bench, developer productivity, multi-agent systems, scaling laws

---

### [Agentic Development Tools and Execution Architectures](/papers/agentic-tools/)

Architectural comparison of Claude Code, Goose, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot - how they differ in execution model, context management, and governance.

**Topics:** Execution architectures, multi-context systems, tool comparison, failure modes

---

### [Spec-Driven Development Framework Patterns](/papers/sdd-frameworks/)

Analysis of BMAD, SpecKit, and OpenSpec frameworks - when to use each, how they integrate with existing workflows, and practical adoption guidance.

**Topics:** Specification-driven development, BDD patterns, contract testing, CI/CD integration

## Companion Articles

These papers are supported by practitioner-focused articles in the [Articles](/articles/) section:

- [The Specification Layer](/articles/specification-layer/) — why enterprises need machine-readable specifications to scale agentic development
- [The Autonomous Agents Loop](/articles/autonomous-agents-loop/) — why autonomous execution loops outperform interactive assistance

## About

These papers are:

- **Practically focused** - real-world implementation over theory
- **Based on primary sources** - official docs, repos, and hands-on experience
- **Open** - free to use, share, and contribute to
