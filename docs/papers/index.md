## Draft Papers

### [Specification-Driven Development and Agentic Execution](/papers/sdd-agentic-execution/)
**Status: Draft | January 2026**

This paper examines what happens when specification-driven development workflows meet agentic execution systems. It focuses on how specifications are interpreted, transformed, and sometimes violated once execution is delegated to autonomous agents.

- How specifications change meaning under autonomous execution
- Execution architecture impacts on specification consumption
- Common failure modes and their manifestations
- Pilot design for surfacing specification-execution friction
- Evaluation approaches without premature commitment

**Target Audience:** Software architects, engineering leaders, platform teams, and teams using SDD frameworks

**Topics:** Specification behavior, execution architectures, failure modes, pilot design, trust calibration
