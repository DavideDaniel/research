### [The Specification Layer: Why Enterprises Can't Scale AI Development Without It](/articles/specification-layer/)

Why explicit, machine-readable specifications are the missing infrastructure for scaling agentic development across enterprise teams. Covers AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, SDD frameworks, and the four-tier specification architecture.

**Topics:** Specification layer, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, SDD frameworks, enterprise scaling

### [The Autonomous Agents Loop: Why AI Agents Produce Better Output When You Stop Interrupting Them](/articles/autonomous-agents-loop/)

Why autonomous AI execution loops outperform interactive assistance, and how enterprises can build the execution environment, context management, and multi-agent infrastructure to capture those gains.

**Topics:** Autonomous execution, Ralph technique, multi-agent architecture, context management, Plan-Execute-Verify-Iterate
